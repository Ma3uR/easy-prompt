# Project Brief: Easy Prompt

## Executive Summary

**Easy Prompt** is an iOS app that generates high-quality social media content plans with optimized prompts for Google's VEO3 video and Imagen 4 image generation tools. It transforms three simple business inputs into a complete week of content ideas, then generates technically perfect JSON prompts on demand for each piece of content.

The app solves the critical gap between content creators who need AI-generated visuals and the deep technical knowledge required to properly prompt Google's advanced AI models. By reducing a complex 12-section SMM brief to just 3 essential inputs and implementing a two-stage generation process (content first, prompts on-demand), Easy Prompt makes professional-quality AI content accessible to anyone in under 3 minutes.

## Problem Statement

Content creators and businesses struggle with a multi-layered problem when attempting to use AI-generated visuals for social media. Currently, they face:

**Current State:** Creators spend 2-4 hours weekly planning content and another 3-5 hours trying to generate usable AI visuals. Most fail to achieve professional quality because VEO3 requires specific JSON structures, camera positioning syntax like "(thats where the camera is)", and complex audio layering specifications. For Google's Imagen 4, users don't understand the hierarchical prompt structure or how to leverage JSON for 300% better consistency.

**Impact:** This knowledge gap costs businesses an estimated $3,000-5,000 monthly in either wasted time, hiring specialists, or using inferior alternatives. Small businesses and solo creators are effectively locked out of using Google's superior AI tools, defaulting to simpler but lower-quality competitors.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:** Current tools either focus on content planning WITHOUT prompt generation (Later, Buffer) or provide generic prompts that don't leverage model-specific optimizations. No solution combines SMM expertise with deep technical knowledge of VEO3's audio requirements and Imagen 4's JSON capabilities.

**Urgency:** With Google's aggressive AI expansion and VEO3's revolutionary audio-visual integration, early movers who master these tools will dominate content creation. The window for establishing market position is 6-12 months before major platforms integrate similar capabilities.

## Proposed Solution

Easy Prompt delivers a radically simplified workflow that encapsulates complex prompt engineering expertise behind an intuitive 3-input interface. The solution focuses purely on generating perfect prompts that users can copy and paste into Google's platforms.

**Core Concept:** A dual-mode system (Quick Mode for instant results, Quality Mode for nuanced output) that generates a week's worth of content ideas first, then creates technically perfect VEO3 and Imagen 4 prompts on-demand for selected content pieces. Users receive JSON-formatted prompts they can directly use in Google AI Studio, ImageFX, or Vertex AI.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **3-Input Simplicity:** While competitors require 12+ fields, we extract maximum context from just business type, target audience, and content goal
- **Model-Specific Mastery:** Deep knowledge of VEO3's JSON structure with audio layers and camera positioning, plus Imagen 4's hierarchical prompt optimization
- **Copy-Paste Ready:** Outputs perfectly formatted JSON prompts that users can directly paste into Google's interfaces
- **Instant Gratification:** Quick Mode delivers results in under 10 seconds, removing friction from the creative process

**Why This Succeeds:** By embedding expert-level prompt engineering knowledge directly into the system prompt and using JSON templates proven to deliver 300% better consistency, Easy Prompt eliminates the learning curve entirely. Users get professional-quality prompts without understanding the underlying complexity - they just copy, paste, and generate.

**High-Level Vision:** Easy Prompt becomes the essential prompt engineering tool for content creators, providing them with the exact prompts that expert AI engineers would craft, formatted perfectly for Google's generation platforms.
